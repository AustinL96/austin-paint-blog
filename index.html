            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Austin and I've been collecting and painting miniatures since the start of 2020. I had an interest in Warhammer 40k for many years before I finally decided to jump into the hobby. And as I tend to do with new hobbies or interests, I dove headfirst and deep! Fast-forward a few years, minus a few thousand dollars, and hundreds of hours and here I am. I love this hobby, simply put.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I've met many new friends I hope to know for many years to come. I speak mainly of the group "Tactical Withdrawal" that I have been a part of for a while now, but many others in the area and now even others in far away states! While I was initially hellbent on increasing my skills in painting my armies, I have since become addicted to the rush of competitive play. I have attended many tournaments now, including large Grand Tournaments with hundreds of players. I have still yet to do very well at one of those, but I know I have it in me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This website is as much for me as it is other people. Here I plan to document my journey as a miniature painting enthusiast, from past to present. It will also contain my methods, paint schemes, and perhaps you will learn from my many mistakes as I recall what ideas worked well and what didn't.

            <h2>Adeptus Custodes</h2>
                <p>
                    The Adeptus Custodes are easily my proudest accomplishment in this hobby. As my first army for Warhammer 40k, the golden giants are the one I am most experienced with, and also my most regarded among friends and strangers. I have received a ton of compliments for my work on this army, a fact that helps counteract the ridiculous amount of time and effort I've placed on them.

            <h2>Chaos Knights</h2>
            <p>
                My second playable army, the fallen Chaos Knights were a passion project created by my desire for a new army that could be built and painted relatively quickly, to stave off the boredom of playing only Custodes. While they play somewhat similarly as an elite army, the army accomplished what I wanted of it. The extra heresy on top was just a nice litte bonus.

            <h2>White Scars (Horus Heresy)</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>"ORDU GAMANA JAGHATAI!"</strong> I hate Chris Wraight sometimes. The man knows how to sell you on an army by writing cool stories about them, that's for sure. He did it first with the Custodes, so it wasn't all that hard for him to do it again with the White Scars. Especially when they have many similarities such as topknots/plumes, a love for polearms, and possess the air of "warrior-scholars". Add onto that one of if not the coolest Primarchs in the whole setting, savagery that doesn't veer into ridiculousness like the Space Wolves, and my need for speed and it's a done deal.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is also the fact that Heresy got a new edition and created a perfect point to jump in via the Age of Darkness set, so that helped too I suppose.

            <h2>Necrons</h2>
            <p>
                These grumpy old skeletons are one of the coolest factions in the whole game, and my second army. However I have not worked on them in some time due to other projects, and the state of the army throughout 40k's 9th edition of the game. However with a new edition likely around the corner, and my burning desire for a change away from "elite" armies, expect to see more of these hitting this blog in the next year. <strong>GLORY TO THE INFINITE EMPIRE!</strong>
